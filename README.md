My AI Usage
AI Tools Used

During the development of this project, I used the following AI tools:

ChatGPT – for conceptual understanding, debugging issues, improving code structure, and writing documentation.

GitHub Copilot – for code auto-completion, generating boilerplate code, and speeding up development in repetitive sections.

How I Used AI Tools

I used AI tools in a responsible and controlled manner throughout the project:

I used ChatGPT to:

Understand backend errors (such as Node.js, npm, and build-related issues).

Get explanations of project architecture and best practices.

Improve logic flow and refactor code for better readability.

Generate documentation content like the README file.

Clarify concepts related to APIs, project structure, and deployment steps.

I used GitHub Copilot to:

Assist with writing repetitive code patterns.

Suggest function templates and syntax while coding.

Speed up development without blindly copying suggestions (all code was reviewed and modified as needed).

Reflection on AI Impact

AI tools significantly improved my productivity and learning efficiency. Instead of spending excessive time searching for solutions, I was able to quickly understand problems and focus on implementing correct logic. AI acted as a supportive assistant, not a replacement for my own thinking.

I ensured that:

I fully understood every piece of AI-assisted code before using it.

All final decisions, logic, and implementations were my own.

AI was used ethically to enhance learning, problem-solving, and code quality.

Overall, AI tools helped me work more efficiently, learn faster, and maintain better code quality while still taking full ownership of the project.
